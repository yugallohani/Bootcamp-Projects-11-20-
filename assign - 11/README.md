# Assign 11: Yugal's Counter App

This project is a simple and modern counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed as part of a bootcamp assignment to demonstrate interactive web development skills.

## Features
- **Increment, Decrement, and Reset**: Easily increase, decrease, or reset the counter value using buttons.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use `ArrowUp (↑)` to increment, `ArrowDown (↓)` to decrement, and `R` to reset the counter for quick access.
- **Responsive & Stylish UI**: The app uses the Poppins font and a card-style layout for a clean, modern look. Animations provide visual feedback on count changes.
- **Prevents Negative Values**: The counter does not go below zero.
