# Assignment 16: React Profile Card with API

This project is a React application that displays modern profile cards for users, fetching live data from the DummyJSON API. Each card shows a user's photo, name, age, company, email, phone, and location, with a clean and responsive design.

## Features
- **Live API Data:** Fetches user profiles from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/users).
- **Profile Cards:** Each card displays photo, name, age, company, email, phone, and location.
- **Fallback Images:** If a user's photo fails to load, a placeholder image is shown.
- **Loading & Error Handling:** Shows a loading indicator and error messages as needed.
- **Responsive Design:** Cards are styled for a modern look and work well on all devices.

## How to Use
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. View the grid of profile cards loaded from the API.
3. If the API fails, an error message will be displayed.
